# FIN-Spurdo Keyboard layout for MacOS

## About

A keyboard layout modified from [PetorSFZ's "Swedish SFZ" layout](https://github.com/PetorSFZ/MacOSX-Improved-Swedish-Keyboard-Layout)

This is my personal keyboard layout modified from 'Swedish Pro' using Ukelele. The main goal is to fix my annoyances with the standard layout, mostly making it more like standard Windows/Linux layouts which I find better for programming.

## Installation

Place files in

	/Library/Keyboard Layouts (All users)
	~/Library/Keyboard Layouts (Only current user)
	
and restart. You can then choose the 'FIN-Spurdo' layout from System Preferences.

## Changes from Swedish SFZ

### €-symbol under AltGr+5

Having the symbol at the same place makes it more compatible with my personal QMK keyboard layer configuration.

### ∞-symbol under Shift+4

Had to put something under the old €-place. Should keep compatibility with most custom MacOS shortcuts requiring this symbol to be accessible.

### New layout icon
